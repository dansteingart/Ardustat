#Ardustat

###The software is currently under development. I apologize for any inconveniences.

###Dependencies:
- Arduino (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- FTDI Drivers / Arduino Uno Drivers, depending on which version of arduino you are using (seeÂ Getting Started guide for arduino at http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).
- We're now a node shop.  
   - Get node [here](http://nodejs.org/)

###Notes:
The ardustat has the capability to do both potentiostatic and galvanostatic electrochemical testing with systems containing 2 to 3 electrodes. It uses a standard arduino board with a custom built shield and can be run from a single USB port. 

####Important Usage Info:

* Working Electrode: Red Wire
* Counter Electrode: Black/Grey Wire
* Reference Electrode: Other Wire

If you are using a two electrode setup be sure to tie the reference electrode to the counter electrode.

####Important Specs
* Current Range: 0.1 microA to 10mA
* Votlage Range: 5V with 0.5mV resolution. (Negative voltages and currents are fine)


###Installation and Setup:
1. Clone this repository
2. Cd into the repository
3. Type `chmod u+x install.sh` to give your self permission to run the install
4. Run the install.sh script `./install.sh`
5. Connect at least one ardustat (maximum of 3 right now)
6. Make sure the correct firmware is uploaded to the arduino. (firmware_030915)
7. On first use run `./starter.sh` (This also starts the pithy server running on 4001 and 4004)
8. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to use the Ardustat
9. On first use, make sure to calibrate the Ardustat
10. For subsequent uses - if "forever" is still running pithy server, start the program with `npm start`

####Questions, Comments, Bugs Etc.
As the software is currently under development there are a few bugs and pieces of functionality missing. I apologise for this. I am currenlty working through a long to-do list to try and rectify this. Please feel free to email me at danielmdavies@gmail.com with any changes you would like to see. Please feel free to contribute!

Best,

Dan D
